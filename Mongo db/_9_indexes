Indexes : it will speed up the search process
	  it takes more memory and slow down the insertion deletion and updation 
	  when we use indexes the database work like a B-tree
	  use indexes where you need lot of searching not lot of updating


db.students.find({name: "Shubham"}).explain("executionStats");		
# this will give the execution stats you can use this to gain data about search
# in the above example we examined five docs due to lenear search given on docsExamined: 5


db.students.createIndex({name: 1})	# to create indexes(1 for alphbetical order -1 for reverse alphbetical order)


db.students.find({name: "Shubham"}).explain("executionStats");
# in the above example we examined only one doc due to lenear search given on docsExamined: 1


db.students.getIndexes()	# to see indexes (_id_ index is default)
 
db.students.dropIndex("name_1")	# to drop the index pass the index name


db.students.getIndexes()	# to see indexes remaining
